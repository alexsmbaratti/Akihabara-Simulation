## Components
### Cars
Cars drive along the streets and pick a random destination at the intersection. They avoid hitting other cars with a CarView object. They stop at intersections when the "signal" is red. If there is a collision, objects in the intersection will be removed after a short time.
### Pedestrians
### Trains
